Creating a weather dashboard with OpenWeather One Call API
<h3>This assignment is currently being worked on.</h3>
<br>
<h4>The purpose of this assignment is to create a weather dashboard that can do the following: 
<p>view searched city:</p>
<ul><li>city name</li>
<li>date</li>
<li>icon representation of weather</li>
<li>temperature</li>
<li>humidity</li>
<li>wind speed</li>
<li>uv index</li></ul>
<p>View the weather forecast for 5 days</p>
<p>UV index is given colors to show if weather conditions are favorable.</p>
<p>store searched cities</p>
<br>
<p>What I have so far is trying to get user input, and using the API to find that city. 
<p>What I need to do: create the right API call to include the city and UV index. Display data on page.
<br>
This is what I have so far:
